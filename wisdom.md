At smelter: "Make pig iron bars"  
Requires:  
    - iron
    - coke (from i.e. bituminous coal) or charcoal (from wood)

- malachite, tetrahedrite -> copper
- lignite, bituminous coal -> coke
- cassiterite -> tin (light!)
- sphalerite -> zince (light)
- galena (50%) -> lead

## 🧈 Other bars worth making at smelter:
- bronze bars = copper bar + tin bar
- bismuth bronze bars = copper bar + tin bar + bismuth bar
- brass bars = zinc bar + copper bar
- electrum = silver + gold

## ⛏️ Good non-economic stones:
- cinnabar (heavy)
- cobaltite (heavy)
- pitchblende (heavy)
